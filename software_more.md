## Bamboo 
### Continuous Integration (and Testing)
Constant merging and testing of code, which leads to finding defects early and saves time on fixing merge issues. Development teams also able receive rapid feedback on their work.

### Continuous Delivery
Deliver software solutions to production and testing environments to help organizations quickly fix bugs and respond to ever-changing business requirements
- Automated building and testing of software
- Reporting tools for statistical analysis
- Visibility info, and control over, release artifacts and environments

## BitBucket

### Version Control
1. Enable teams located anywhere to share sources and integrate with software development tools to automate the release pipeline.
2. Form a feedback loop with your continuous integration and continuous delivery processes. Use webhooks to trigger your CI builds from commits, and use tags to tag each commit that is built into a release candidate.
