# SHIP (Secure Hybrid Integrated Pipeline)

## What is SHIP?

About SHIP is a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platform solution for Whole of-Government (WOG).

By offering a common development platform, automating delivery of applications and simplifying policy clearance, SHIP establishes a consistent and automated way for continuous integration, continuous testing and delivery to create better quality products faster.

This is achieved through incorporating a Common Development Stack, Standard Build Management, and Centralised Release Management for application development in both external internet and internal WOG intranet environment:

### i. Common Development Stack
Comprises of basic development tools for a development team to collaborate, perform project tracking, source code and binary management in a secure development environment. The objective is to allow development teams to perform tasks such as code review, branching strategy, product backlog grooming, development tracking and documentation in a collaborative manner.

### ii. Common Build Environment
Offers managed build engines, automated software builds to allow continuous integration and secure library management in an applicationâ€™s lifecycle. This is essential to promote building from source using an independent standard build environment, building artifact management and driving policy-as-code development.

### iii. Release Management (Upcoming)
Offers continuous deployment and delivery to multiple target hosts and zones. It serves a centralised platform to build artifact review, release review, audit review, control release with authorization and authentication, release monitory and release configuration management.
