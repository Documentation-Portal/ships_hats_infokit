# BitBucket

## Version Control
1. Enable teams located anywhere to share sources and integrate with software development tools to automate the release pipeline.
2. Form a feedback loop with your continuous integration and continuous delivery processes. Use webhooks to trigger your CI builds from commits, and use tags to tag each commit that is built into a release candidate.
